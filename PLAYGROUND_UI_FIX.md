# Playground UI Form Submission Fix

This document outlines the changes made to fix the Playground UI POST payload to include all required fields for the `/api/project/start` endpoint.

## Problem

The frontend at agent-playground-ui.vercel.app was sending incomplete data to the `/api/project/start` endpoint. The backend debug trap showed:

```
ðŸ§ª Project start triggered: None Build a basic CRM SaaS product with HAL and NOVA None
```

This indicated that the frontend was only sending the `goal` field, missing both `project_id` and `agent` fields.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Added Project ID Generation

Added automatic project ID generation using the current timestamp:

```javascript
const [projectId, setProjectId] = useState(`demo_${Date.now()}`);

// In submitGoal function:
const effectiveProjectId = `demo_${Date.now()}`;
setProjectId(effectiveProjectId);
```

### 2. Added Agent Field with Default Value

Added a state variable for the agent with "orchestrator" as the default value:

```javascript
const [agent, setAgent] = useState('orchestrator');
```

### 3. Updated Form Submission Payload

Modified the fetch request to include all three required fields:

```javascript
body: JSON.stringify({ 
  project_id: effectiveProjectId,
  goal,
  agent
})
```

### 4. Enhanced UI

- Added a disabled input field to display the auto-generated project ID
- Added a dropdown selector for choosing different agents
- Improved form layout with proper labels and styling
- Added validation to disable the submit button when goal is empty

## Expected Outcome

The updated form will now send a complete payload to the backend:

```json
{
  "project_id": "demo_1713506789123",
  "goal": "Build a basic CRM SaaS product with HAL and NOVA",
  "agent": "orchestrator"
}
```

This should result in the backend logs showing:

```
ðŸ§ª Project start triggered: demo_1713506789123 Build a basic CRM SaaS product with HAL and NOVA orchestrator
```

## Dependencies

Added the UUID package for potential future use in generating unique IDs:

```
npm install uuid
```

## Testing

The implementation has been tested locally by:
1. Starting the development server
2. Verifying the form displays correctly with all fields
3. Confirming the project ID is auto-generated
4. Checking that the agent dropdown defaults to "orchestrator"

## Next Steps

After deployment to production:
1. Submit a goal from the Playground UI
2. Confirm the backend logs include a valid project ID and agent
3. Verify the complete cognitive loop works with the updated payload
