# Promethios Agent Playground UI Implementation

This document provides an overview of the Promethios Agent Playground UI implementation, including its features, components, and design decisions.

## Overview

The Promethios Agent Playground UI is a real-time, dark-mode interface that displays live agent execution, loop status, and file generation. It connects to the status API to fetch and display project data with automatic updates.

## Features

### 1. Dark Mode Theme

The UI implements a dark mode theme with the following color scheme:
- Background: `#0e0e0e`
- Text: `#e0e0e0`
- Highlight: `#00ffc8` (neon green)
- Secondary Background: `#121212`
- Border: `#333333`

The theme is applied globally using CSS variables, making it easy to maintain and update.

### 2. Two-Panel Layout

The UI features a responsive two-panel layout:
- **Left Panel (70%)**: Agent Feed showing agent progress and activity
- **Right Panel (30%)**: Live File Tree displaying generated files

On mobile devices, the panels stack vertically for better usability.

### 3. Loop Mode Badge

A glowing badge in the top-left corner shows:
- Loop Mode status (Active)
- Current loop count pulled from the API

The badge features a pulsing glow animation to draw attention.

### 4. Next Step Status

A terminal-style display shows the next recommended step with:
- Clear indication of the next agent to run
- Blinking cursor effect for terminal feel
- Typing animation for dynamic appearance

### 5. Animations & Effects

The UI includes several animations to enhance the user experience:
- **Fade-in**: For file tree items and agent timeline entries
- **Blinking Cursor**: For terminal-like feel in text displays
- **Glowing Effect**: For the loop badge
- **Typing Animation**: For the next step display
- **Pulse Animation**: For status badges
- **Loading Animation**: For loading states

### 6. Responsive Design

The UI is fully responsive with:
- Flexible layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- Media queries for mobile-specific adjustments
- Stacking panels on smaller screens
- Adjusted spacing and alignment for mobile devices

## Components

### PlaygroundStatusPanel

This component displays:
- Loop Mode Badge with current loop count
- Project ID
- Next Step Status with terminal styling

```jsx
<PlaygroundStatusPanel 
  projectId={projectId}
  loopCount={projectData?.loop_count || 0}
  nextStep={projectData?.next_recommended_step || 'Initializing...'}
/>
```

### AgentTimeline

This component shows:
- Agent activity with emoji icons
- Status badges (Latest, Complete)
- Conversational English phrases describing agent actions
- Special styling for the most recent agent

```jsx
<AgentTimeline 
  completedSteps={projectData?.completed_steps || []}
  lastCompletedAgent={projectData?.last_completed_agent}
/>
```

### FileTree

This component displays:
- Recursive directory structure with proper indentation
- Fade-in animations for file items
- Sorted items (directories first, then files alphabetically)

```jsx
<FileTree files={projectData?.files_created || []} />
```

## API Integration

The UI connects to the status API endpoint:
```
GET /api/project/:project_id/status
```

Data is fetched on component mount and then polled every 5 seconds for real-time updates.

## Error Handling

The UI includes proper error handling:
- Loading states during data fetching
- Error messages when API calls fail
- Fallback values when data is missing

## Styling Approach

The UI uses:
- CSS variables for theme colors
- Inline styles for component-specific styling
- Global CSS for animations and responsive design
- Media queries for different screen sizes

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements include:
- Project selector to switch between different projects
- More detailed agent activity logs
- File content preview
- Interactive terminal for agent commands
- Dark/light theme toggle

## Deployment

The UI is ready for deployment and can be built using:
```
npm run build
```

## Testing

The UI has been tested for:
- Proper component integration
- Responsive design across different screen sizes
- Animation and effect functionality
- Error state handling

Note: During testing, API connectivity issues were observed with the endpoint returning "Not Found" responses. This should be investigated with the backend team.
